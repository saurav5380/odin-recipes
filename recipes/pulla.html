    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>½ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>9 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm milk in a small saucepan over medium heat until it bubbles, then remove from heat. Let cool until lukewarm.</li>
            <li>Stir together warm water and yeast in a large bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir lukewarm milk, sugar, 4 beaten eggs, salt, and cardamom into yeast mixture. Beat in 2 cups flour until combined. </li>
            <li>Add 3 cups flour and beat until dough is smooth and elastic. Add melted butter; beat until glossy. Mix in remaining flour until dough is stiff.</li>
            <li>Transfer dough to a floured surface, cover with an inverted mixing bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Knead dough until smooth and satiny, then place in a lightly greased mixing bowl and turn dough to coat. Cover with a dish towel; let rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. </li>
            <li>Punch down dough; let rise again until almost doubled, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Grease 2 baking sheets.</li>
            <li>Turn dough out again onto a floured surface and divide into 3 equal pieces. Divide each piece into thirds. </li>
            <li>Roll each piece into a 12- to 16-inch strip. Braid 3 strips into a loaf to get 3 large, braided loaves. Lift loaves onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover with a dish towel and let rise for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Beat together 1 egg and water in a small bowl. Brush over loaves and sprinkle with sugar.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Check occasionally because the bottoms of loaves can burn quickly.</li>
        </ol>
